# porA
Scripts for porA amplicon analysis. 

These scripts are made for our internal conda environments, and those will need to be either installed or modified in the scripts. Yaml files of our environment are shared. 


The script dada2_auto.R should be run per sequencing run. Options for running it can be seen with dada2_auto.R -h 

Then the script dada2_combine_datasets_Flok_plots_amplicon_file_parallel_clean_share.R should be run to plot the results for either one or multiple sequencing runs afterwards. 

porA_wgs_ampl2.py is for finding the porA type in WGS sequences.
